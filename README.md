# I94 Single Source of Truth Data Warehouse

## Project purpose and scope

United States Department of Homeland Security decided to create a single source of truth database to analyze immigrant behavior. They provided a variety of datasets including I94 immigration data logs, U.S. cities demographics, travel ports, and approximate temperatures across cities.

## Data model

Star schema shall be inserted here

## Files
    1. I94 Immigration data
        * This contains immigrants information
    2. Global Land and Temperatures
    3. US Cities Demographics
    4. Airport codes
        * This contains information about airports, heliports and sea plane bases

## Considerations
* Unnamed column in immigration dataset will be dropped since there is no information about it.
* Non-US data in the temperatures dataset will be cleaned.

*Note: See the data exploration and cleaning section for further details.*
